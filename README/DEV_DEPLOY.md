## Hypothetical Deploying from Dev

### Background

As of 31 May 2024, SocialPredict does not have a production version launched. That is to say, SocialPredict is designed for development, meaning out of the box, everything it comes with can be worked on within a local machine, but it's not set up to be served securely as a production instance on the web that can't be easily hacked.

That being said, while not recommended, it is possible to adapt the development version of SocialPredict to run in a production environment in its current state, for small and experimental deployments.

This document is geared at helping those who might want to convert the development version of socialpredict into a web deployment. While not all-encompassing and user caution is encouraged, this document can serve as a general guideline to get going.
